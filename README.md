# Mosaic Tesserae Segmentation with SAM2 (Fine-Tuning)

**Work in Progress**

This repository contains experiments for fine-tuning Meta's **SAM2 (Segment Anything Model)** to segment mosaic images into individual tesserae.  

## Features

- Custom dataset creation with real and artificially tesserified mosaic images  
- Guided segmentation during training using manually annotated points  
- Iterative refinement for challenging regions  
- Post-processing for cleaner tesserae masks  

## Note

This repository is currently empty and will be updated with code, datasets, and experiments.
